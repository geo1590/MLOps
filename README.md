## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how the MLflow AI/ML framework can be implemented in a production environment. Also, I completed an MLOps certification and am building some MLOps personal projects. This is meant to be for educational purposes.

## MLflow
MLflow is a framework for managing AI/ML projects. It can do tracking, packaging, store of models & datasets, and deployment of your projects.<br><br>
